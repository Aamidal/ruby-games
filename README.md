# ruby-games
This repo houses small games built as projects for The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum.

## Main.rb

A game loader I'm experimenting with, which creates a menu of all games in libs/games and allows the user to select one to play.

## Tic_tic_tac.rb

A messy first attempt at OOP tic-tac-toe. Lets players pick their own symbol and colors. Declining to play again returns you to main.rb

## string_methods.rb

Additions to the Ruby String class:

1. #titleize is stolen from Rails and is used to format the main menu. <br.>
```
"here_is_an_example_string".titleize => "Here Is An Example String"
```
2. #colorize colors texting using ANSI values.
